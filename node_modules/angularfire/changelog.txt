feature - Improved performance (and fixed some timing bugs) by replacing custom internal batching logic with Angular's `$evalAsync()`.
changed - The `new` keyword is now optional for services which use `$extend()` to add functionality to `$firebaseArray` and `$firebaseObject`.
removed - Removed unnecessary debug logging in `$firebaseArray.$destroy()`.
fixed - `$waitForAuth()` and `$requireAuth()` now properly detect authentication state changes.
fixed - Fixed cases where `$$error()` was being called on `null` objects.
fixed - Resolved inconsistent argument validation in `$changeEmail()` (thanks to @whitneyit).
